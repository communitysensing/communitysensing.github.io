      <h2>Environmental Protection and Agency: Motivations, Capacity, and Goals in Participatory Sensing </h2>

        Environmental Protection and Agency: Motivations, Capacity, and Goals in Participatory Sensing.  
	<em>Proc. CHI 2017</em>, May 2017, 3138-3150.</p>
      <p>In this paper we consider various genres of citizen science from the perspective of citizen participants. As a mode of scientific inquiry, citizen science has the potential to "scale up" scientific data collection efforts and increase lay engagement with science. However, current technological directions risk losing sight of the ways in which citizen science is actually practiced. As citizen science is increasingly used to describe a wide range of activities, we begin by presenting a framework of citizen science genres. We then present findings from four interlocking qualitative studies and technological interventions of community air quality monitoring efforts, examining the motivations and capacities of citizen participants and characterizing their alignment with different types of citizen science. Based on these studies, we suggest that data acquisition involves complex multi-dimensional tradeoffs, and the commonly held view that citizen science systems are a win-win for citizens and science may be overstated.

      <h2>Common Sense Community: Scaffolding Mobile Sensing and Analysis for Novice Users</h2>

	S. Subramanian, and A. Woodruff.  Common Sense Community:
	Scaffolding Mobile Sensing and Analysis for Novice
	Users.  <em>Proc. Pervasive 2010</em>, May 2010,

      <p>As sensing technologies become increasingly distributed and
      democratized, citizens and novice users are becoming responsible
      for the kinds of data collection and analysis that have
      traditionally been the purview of professional scientists and
      analysts. Leveraging this citizen engagement effectively,
      however, requires not only tools for sensing and data collection
      but also mechanisms for understanding and utilizing input from
      both novice and expert stakeholders.  When successful, this
      process can result in actionable findings that leverage and
      engage community members and build on their experiences and
      observations.  We explored this process of knowledge production
      through several dozen interviews with novice community members,
      scientists, and regulators as part of the design of a mobile air
      quality monitoring system. From these interviews, we derived
      design principles and a framework for describing data collection
      and knowledge generation in citizen science settings,
      culminating in the user-centered design of a system for
      community analysis of air quality data. Unlike prior systems,
      ours breaks analysis tasks into discrete mini-applications
      designed to facilitate and scaffold novice contributions. An
      evaluation we conducted with community members in an area with
      air quality concerns indicates that these mini-applications help
      participants identify relevant phenomena and generate local
      knowledge contributions. <a href="http://www.paulaoki.com/papers/pervasive10.pdf">Download

      <h2>Common Sense: Participatory Urban Sensing Using a Network
of Handheld Air Quality Monitors</h2>

      A. Mainwaring, C. Myers, W. Willett, and A. Woodruff.  Common
      Sense: Participatory Urban Sensing Using a Network of Handheld
      Air Quality Monitors (demonstration). <em>Proc. SenSys
      2009,</em> Berkeley, CA, Nov. 2009, 349-350.</p>
      <p>Poor air quality is a global health issue, causing serious
      problems like asthma, cancer, and heart disease around the
      world.  Earlier this decade, the World Health Organization
      estimated that three million people die each year from the
      effects of air pollution.  Unfortunately, while variations in
      air quality are significant, today's air quality monitors are
      very sparsely deployed.  To address this visibility gap, the
      Common Sense project is developing participatory sensing systems
      that allow individuals to measure their personal exposure,
      groups to aggregate their members' exposure, and activists to
      mobilize grassroots community
      action. <a href="http://www.paulaoki.com/papers/sensys09-demo.pdf">Download

      <h2>A Vehicle for Research: Using Street Sweepers to Explore the
      Landscape of Environmental Community Action</h2>

      C. Myers, E. Paulos, S. Subramanian, and A. Woodruff.  A Vehicle
      for Research: Using Street Sweepers to Explore the Landscape of
      Environmental Community Action. <em> Proc. CHI 2009, </em> Boston,
      MA, Apr. 2009, 375-384. <em>Best Paper Nominee.</em></p>
      <p>Researchers are developing mobile sensing platforms to
      facilitate public awareness of environmental
      conditions. However, turning such awareness into practical
      community action and political change requires more than just
      collecting and presenting data.  To inform research on mobile
      environmental sensing, we conducted design fieldwork with
      government, private, and public interest stakeholders. In
      parallel, we built an environmental air quality sensing system
      and deployed it on street sweeping vehicles in a major
      U.S. city; this served as a “research vehicle” by grounding our
      interviews and affording us status as environmental action
      researchers.  In this paper, we present a qualitative analysis
      of the landscape of environmental action, focusing on insights
      that will help researchers frame meaningful technological
      interventions. <a href="http://www.paulaoki.com/papers/chi09.pdf">Download

      <h2>Common Sense: Mobile Environmental Sensing Platforms to
      Support Community Action and Citizen Science</h2>
      <p class="smallText">P.M. Aoki, R.J. Honicky, A. Mainwaring,
      C. Myers, E. Paulos, S. Subramanian, and A. Woodruff.  Common
      Sense: Mobile Environmental Sensing Platforms to Support

      Adjunct Proceedings Ubicomp 2008,</em> Sep. 2008, 59-60.</p>
      <p>The Common Sense project is developing mobile environmental
      sensing platforms to support grassroots community action.  To
      this end, we are building a family of hardware and software
      components that can be used in a range of applications, as well
      as developing new communication paradigms that enable
      communities of non- experts to gather and produce information
      that is “credible enough” for experts and policy-makers.  The
      demonstration showcases one such platform, currently deployed on
      street-sweeping vehicles in a major
      U.S. city. <a href="http://www.paulaoki.com/papers/ubicomp08-demo.pdf">Download
